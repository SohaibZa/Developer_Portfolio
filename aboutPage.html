        &lt;About the Portfolio Page/&gt;
    </h1>
    <p>This page is under construction thats why some features like the projects and contact section are just there without any actual functionality. Which will be added later so wait for it.Some links like FAQs, facebook and insta are also unavailable.The hire me button is not really serving any purpose.In short only the landing , about and education section are completed. The stack section will have some more elements soon with a new design. This is just 1st prototype of my portfolio. I believe single page is better than making such a long page making the user scroll so much instead navigation through navbar or menus is way better. So its not the final Product. Thanks if you read it!ðŸ¥¹</p>
